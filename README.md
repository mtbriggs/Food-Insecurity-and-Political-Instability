# The United Nations included ending hunger as one of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, with the aim to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030 (United Nations, 2015). As high rates of food insecurity are frequently found in countries where government institutions are unstable, researchers have discovered a possible relationship between food security and political stability. Various metrics have been developed to help quantify the levels of hunger and undernourishment, and they can be used to inform the inputs to statistical models when evaluating political stability levels. One of these metrics is the Global Hunger Index (GHI) which scores each country according to their respective levels of hunger and undernourishment ranging from extremely alarming to non-reported (see Appendix A for a map of GHI scores). This paper uses data from the GHI along with Food Security Indicators data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to explore the relationship between food security and political stability. The FAO Food Security Indicators database includes a variety of measures from four categories: availability, access, stability, and utilization.
